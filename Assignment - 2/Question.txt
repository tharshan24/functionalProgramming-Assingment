Write Scala functions to solve the following problems. 

You scala program should upload to same gitLab/gitHub repository.



Q1. Company XYZ & Co. pays all its employees Rs.150 per normal working hour and Rs. 75 per OT hour. 
    A typical employee works 40 (normal) and 20(OT) hours per week has to pay 10% tax. 
    Develop a functional program that determines the take home salary of an employee
    from the number of working hours and OT hours given.

Q2. Imagine the owner of a movie theater who has complete freedom in setting ticket prices.
    The more he charges, the fewer the people who can afford tickets.
    In a recent experiment the owner determined a precise relationship
    between the price of a ticket and average attendance.
    At a price of Rs 15.00 per ticket, 120 people attend a performance.
    Decreasing the price by  5 Rupees increases attendance by 20 and
    increasing the price by 5 Rupees decreases attendance by 20.
    Unfortunately, the increased attendance also comes at an increased cost.
    Every performance costs the owner Rs.500. Each attendee costs another 3 Rupees.
    The owner would like to know the exact relationship between profit and ticket price
    so that he can determine the price at which he can make the highest profit.
    Implement a functional program to find out the best ticket price.
